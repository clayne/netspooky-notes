Oneliner to clear the screen `echo -ne "\x1b\x5b\x48\x1b\x5b\x32\x4a\x1b\x5b\x33\x4a"`

As base64 `base64 -d <<< G1tIG1syShtbM0o=`

This also does this, but it's shorter and it's supposed to work on older systems. `echo -ne "\x1bc"`

hahaha `base64 -d <<< G2N1` clears the screen and puts a u at the top left

This clears and puts U's til the end of the console line `base64 -d <<< G2NVG1s5OTli`
